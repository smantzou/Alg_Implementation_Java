# Alg_Implementation_Java
####Not maintained !
A simple java code that implements the Minimum Spanning Tree , Union-Find and Stable Marriage Algorythms.
The code asks for a filename , in which the form of id,x-coord,y--coord and for odd number of Id a bucket and for even numbers seeds.
The algorythms work on the hypothesis that the data insertions are an ant colony and the odd IDs are red ants and even IDs are black ants.
The MST works like anyone would.Union-Find works on the same basis as MST. The Stable Marriage takes into account the last column of the data rows , in this column the red ant have a bucket and the ants have picked up seeds and the numbers are the seeds weight and the capacity of the bucket.The Stable Marriage algorythm wants to find the best couples for the best seeds and buckets combination between red and black ants.
