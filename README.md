# Alg_Implementation_Java
####Not maintained !
A simple java code that implements the Minimum Spanning Tree , Union-Find and Stable Marriage Algorythms.
The code asks for a filename , that has the form of id,x-coord,y--coord and for odd number of Id a bucket and for even numbers seeds.
The algorythms functions on the hypothesis that the data insertions are an ant colony and the odd IDs are red ants and even IDs are black ants.
The MST works like anyone would.Union-Find works on the same basis as MST. The Stable Marriage takes into account the last column of the data rows , because the black ants want to find the 
best red ant and maximize the functionality of their bucket.
